Template documents are defined with `<h1>` and code blocks. `<h1>` is interpreted as the file name and code blocks as the template body. Meta information is defined using [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

## Structure

scaffdog allows templates to be written in Markdown for superior integration with editors and reduced review load.

The simplest structure is shown below.

````markdown
---
name: 'template'
root: '.'
output: '**/*'
---

# `filename.txt`

```
template body
```
````

A single markdown file consists of three blocks.

- **Attributes**: Meta information about the template document described in Front Matter.
- **Template title**: File name to be described by `<h1>`.
- **Template body**: File content to be described in code blocks.

Read our docs for [Attributes](/docs/templates/attributes) and [Template Engine](/docs/templates/template-engine) to learn more.

## File-scope Variables

The `Variables` section is special and is not output to a file. The key-value (`key: value`) list allows you to declare variables that can be used in common templates.

This is useful for processing input values that are commonly used in templates.

````markdown
# Variables

- constant_key: scaffdog
- computed_key: `{{ inputs.name | upper }}`

# `filename.txt`

```
{{ constant_key }}
{{ computed_key }}
```
````

If `scaffdog` is entered in `inputs.name`, the output is as follows:

```
scaffdog
SCAFFDOG
```

## Conditional Generates

Template title prefixed with `!` token to skip file generation.

A common use case is to branch according to the content of the accepted input.

````markdown
---
name: 'component'
root: '.'
output: '.'
questions:
  test:
    confirm: 'Do you need a test?'
    initial: true
---

# `{{ inputs.test && "!" }}index.test.ts`

```typescript
// ...
```
````
