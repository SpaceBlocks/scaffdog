scaffdog can inject code into already existing files! :pick:  
Injection can be achieved by using the helper function. The following are some examples.

## Append

You can use the [read](/docs/templates/helpers#read) helper function and `output.abs` to get the file to output.  
If you want to append a text to the last line, put a body after the call to the `read` helper function.

````markdown
# `index.js`

```javascript
{{ read output.abs }}
console.log('last line');
```
````

## Prepend

Using much the same mechanism as the [Append](#append) section, text can be added to the first line.

````markdown
# `index.js`

```javascript
console.log('first line');
{{ read output.abs }}
```
````

## Before / After

There may be cases where you want to add text to a specific line in a file's contents. The [before](/docs/templates/helpers#before) and [after](/docs/templates/helpers#after) helper functions make it easy!

For example, if you want to add text to the first blank line, the case is as follows:

````markdown
# `index.js`

```javascript
{{ read output.abs | before "^$" }}
console.log('first blank line');
{{ read output.abs | after "^$" -1 }}
```
````

The `before` and `after` helper functions each retrieve values that do not include the specified line, so you will need to adjust the position of the inject by making use of the `offset`.

## At line

The `before` and `after` helper functions are also useful when you want to add text to a specific line.

````markdown
# `index.js`

```javascript
{{ read output.abs | before 6 }}
console.log('line at 6');
{{ read output.abs | after 6 -1 }}
```
````
